//This is where the main application code would be written that gets shared across all use cases

//All code here should be exportable because you would always import the core code into your
//own use case and use that as the entry point in webpack. Webpack should never use core as an
//entry point.

//This can be one main index that gets imported once into your use case. Or it can be a collection
//of core components and files that get imported into your use case as needed. Whatever satifies
//your needs.
